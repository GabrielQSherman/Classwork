4/6/2020

first day working on calendar navigation project

the goal is to create a user-interface that allows a user to select a date easily and quickly
no dates should be left out, and no dates should be 'impossible' dates ie 'Feb. 29th 2019'

The first goal is to create buttons(controls the date being displayed) and a heading element(displays the date) on an html page using pure JS
