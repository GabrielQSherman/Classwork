first day working on calendar navigation project

the goal is to create a user-interface that allows a user to select a date easily and quickly
no dates should be left out, and no dates should be 'impossible' dates ie 'Feb. 29th 2019'

The first goal is to create buttons(controls the date being displayed) and a heading element(displays the date) on an html page using pure JS

[*] created functions that will create heading/button elements and append them to the dom
    utilized these functions to set up a user interface quickly

[*] create a function that will set up the user interface with one function call

[*] create the onclick function that will be called by each button, using the 'this' keyword the program can acess the element that called the function, then using the id property, the currentDate object will change accordingly
