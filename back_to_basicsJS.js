/*
one way to declare a variable that will be set at the global scope is using the 'var' keyword
and then the name of your variable following the key word
*/

//name will know be a variable in this code, but it will have a value of 'undefined'
var name;

//3 & 4

//using the assignment operater '=' you can set a value to a variable, so that it is not undefined

//You are able to assign the value when it is initialized or after it has been initialized

var newVar = 3; //this is now an interger variable, but it can be reassined to any value type. 

newVar = 'hello world'; //now myVar is a string and there will be no syntax error
//you can also reasign a variable to another variables value

//5. 
//variable names are case sensitive, therefore a programer must be careful to check not only their spelling of var names but also where their capitalization
// this is why camel case is common practice and should be used by all programers
